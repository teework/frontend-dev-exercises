# Overview #

Write a single page JavaScript application that allows one to search Github.com for repos by keyword.

There is no one way to complete this exercise as long as the minimum requirements are met.

## Requirements ##

1. You can edit *app.js* *styles.css* and the `<body>` of *index.html*. jQuery and Underscore are provided, using either is optional, but don't use additional libraries or plugins.
2. index.html contains three elements: one for the search term, one for the results, and one for an overlay. You may add more if you see fit.
3. The results should show as a list with each item displaying the *name* and *owner* of the repository.
4. When a result is clicked, display - in any manner you would like - the repo's *language*, *followers*, *url* and *description*.
5. The search term should be cached so duplicate searches do not trigger further requests to Github. Do not rely on browser caching for this.

## Notes ##
- Minimal styling is fine, be as creative as you'd like.
- Bonus points if it looks good and works well on mobile tablet and desktop.
- The user action to initiate a search is up to you.
- Solution does not need to support older browsers.
- Take as much (or little) time as you like, there is no time requirement or expectation.
- Code quality is just as important as a functional app. The code you write speaks to your experience, preferences and style much more than a resume.
